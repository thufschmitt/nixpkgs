 <title>Profiles</title>
 <para>
  In some cases, it may be desirable to take advantage of commonly-used,
  predefined configurations provided by nixpkgs, but different from those that
  come as default. This is a role fulfilled by NixOS's Profiles, which come as
  files living in <filename>&lt;nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles&gt;</filename>.
  That is to say, expected usage is to add them to the imports list of your
  <filename>/etc/configuration.nix</filename> as such:
 </para>
<programlisting>
  imports = [
   &lt;nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/profile-name.nix&gt;
  ];
</programlisting>
 <para>
  Even if some of these profiles seem only useful in the context of install
  media, many are actually intended to be used in real installs.
 </para>
 <para>
  What follows is a brief explanation on the purpose and use-case for each
  profile. Detailing each option configured by each one is out of scope.
